The surface of the hill and its interface were only discretized by quadratic elements to elaborate on the computational model. First, a brief formulation of the method and the modified boundary integral equation with damping were presented. Then, the method was implemented in a developed DASBEM algorithm and analyzed as a verification example to compare with the literature and confirm the obtained results. Finally, an advanced numerical study was carried out to sensitize the key parameters of the model, including the isotropy factor, shape ratio of the hill, incident wave angle, and frequency content. The results showed that the proposed method had the powerful ability to create sharp corner features. Also, the orientation of the material texture of the triangular hill was extremely effective on the seismic ground response and changing the amplification patterns."},

The stress-free boundary condition at the ground surface is satisfied using wave source image theory. To account for material damping, the Barkan approach is employed to attenuate the half-space by introducing a constant logarithmic reduction into the modified boundary integral equation. This method is easily implemented in a time-domain computer code for analyzing seismic homogeneous orthotropic mediums. To model underground inclusions, a sub-structuring approach is introduced to ensure continuity conditions at interfaces based on node position and normal direction. Several practical examples involving SH-waves are solved and compared with existing literature to validate surface response, particularly focusing on isotropic convergence. A favorable agreement is found between responses, confirming the capability of the proposed method for simple modeling of orthotropic subsurface features. Finally, in the form of an advanced numerical study, the surface motions of orthotropic models, including an underground inclusion embedded in a linear elastic half-space were successfully obtained under transient SH-wave propagation. Utilizing the time-domain boundary element approach, a simple model was developed only by discretizing the boundaries/interfaces. To illustrate responses in the time/frequency-domain, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is performed considering parameters such as frequency, shape ratio, and isotropy factor, visualized through snapshots, seismograms, and amplification patterns. Results demonstrate that orthotropic anisotropy significantly influences seismic patterns of ground surfaces, highlighting the impact of mentioned parameter variations."},
    {title:"Seismic Response of the Orthotropic Ground Surface Including Underground Circular Unlined Tunnel",authors:"Saeed Mojtabazadeh, Mehdi Panji & Mohsen Kamalian",year:"2025",href:"https://bayanbox.ir/download/16572426325719444/26.pdf",journal:"https://www.jsce.ir/article_199086.html?lang=en",thumb:"https://bayanbox.ir/view/2445473100347626734/26.jpg",abstract:"The actual behavior of the ground surface in the presence of underground structures is strongly influenced by a thorough understanding of the effects of anisotropy in the surrounding half-space. This anisotropy, typically manifested as orthotropic behavior in the soil layers, is intricately linked with the seismic response of orthotropic ground surface. Therefore, this article presents the seismic response of orthotropic ground surface in the presence of an underground circular tunnel without lining subjected to incident SH-waves. The problem model is prepared solely using the boundary element method in the time-domain, with tunnel boundary discretization. Material damping is indirectly applied using exponential functions in integral equations. In addition to providing a brief formulation of the method, several verification examples are analyzed, focusing on key model parameters such as isotropy factor, frequency content, and wave incidence angle. The seismic response of the ground surface containing an unlined circular tunnel is sensitively investigated in both time and frequency domains. The results indicate that the orthotropic properties of materials and geological formations are influential not only in the response amplitudes but also in the amplification patterns around the tunnel and the establishment of safe zones. Additionally, a maximum surface amplification of 3.2 is observed during the onset of horizontal wave-front."},

The time-domain orthotropic half-space boundary element method, previously proposed by the authors, was employed to analyze the aforementioned problem. Upon validation of the results using a convergence approach, a comprehensive parametric study focusing on certain key parameters such as isotropy factor, valley aspect ratio, and frequency content was conducted. The results were primarily presented as snapshots and three-dimensional outcomes in both the time and frequency domains. The results indicated that the material properties of the valley and the orientation of geological formations significantly affect the seismic amplification pattern of the ground surface. Moreover, the maximum valley amplification of 2.14 occurred for periods less than 0.5 and the assumed maximum isotropy factor."},

The model was elaborated only by discretizing the hill surface and its interface with the underlying half-space through the use of image source theory and the substructure approach. To improve the model at the corners, the double node procedure was applied to the extreme nodes of the quadratic elements. An attenuation ratio is implemented in the boundary equations using a decremental exponential function. After presenting the technique, a validation example is presented alongside the literature to measure the convergence with an isotropic response. Next, a sample Gaussian-shaped hill model is prepared under propagating obliquely incident SH-waves as a common sample topography and the surface response is obtained by considering some significant parameters as well as the shape ratio, isotropy factor, frequency content, and angle of the incident wave. The ground surface response is sensitized in two time and frequency domains. The results showed that the amplitude of the response was not only dependent on the impedance ratio but also the orthotropy ratio, which was always effective in orienting the wave-front to amplify the ground movement."},

The Ricker wavelet was considered for the incident wave function. In the use of the proposed method, the boundary around the tunnel was only required to be discretized. After comparing the results of the present study with existing analytical responses, it was found that the method had good accuracy in modeling horseshoe-shaped tunnels. The responses are presented as two-/three-dimensional diagrams in the time/frequency domain. Also, a comparative study is carried out between circular and horseshoe cross-sections to observe the effect of the geometry on the response pattern. The results show that the existence of subsurface openings as well as horseshoe-shaped cavities has a significant effect on the variation of seismic patterns and critical states of the ground surface. The used method can be proposed to geotechnical engineers for preparing simple underground models to achieve the transient responses."},

In the use of the time-domain boundary element approach, a simple model was developed only by discretizing the interface. To achieve better convergence of the response, an attenuation rule was implemented with the assistance of the reduction exponential function applied in the boundary integral equations. After a brief overview of the method, the heterogonous sub-structured basin model was created and decomposed into two parts to satisfy the modified continuity conditions based on the normal direction at the interface node position. The developed computer code was tested by solving a validation example.

By changing the spatial variable, the time-domain half-space Green's functions were obtained in an isotropic-like analytical process by solving the singular form of the scalar wave equation. The stress-free boundary condition of the ground surface was satisfied using the wave source image theory. To include the materials damping, the Barkan approach was used in the formulation to attenuate the half-space by applying a constant logarithmic reduction into the modified boundary integral equation. The closed-form attenuated orthotropic half-space scalar kernels were obtained in the time-domain for displacement/traction fields by analytical integration of Green's functions. The method was easily implemented in a time-domain computer code to analyse the seismic homogenous orthotropic medium. To elaborate the model of the heterogeneous problems, a substructuring approach was presented to satisfy the continuity conditions at the interface depending on the position of the node and normal. Then, several seismic problems including a surface canyon, an underground cavity, a subsurface inclusion, and an alluvial valley subjected to SH wave was solved and compared with the literature to validate the surface response in the case of isotropic convergence. To evaluate the accuracy and the time of analysis for the proposed method versus the full-space boundary element models, a comparative test was carried out for two examples. A favourite agreement was testified between the responses to verify the proposed method's capability for simple modelling of the orthotropic topographic features. Finally, the ability of the method to analyse the problems with high degrees of freedom was investigated by solving a half-space model including 25 subsurface orthotropic circular inclusions."},

A model of long two-dimensional lined tunnels is established and embedded in a homogeneous linear elastic half-plane by an applied numerical time-domain boundary element approach. In addition to a brief introduction to the formulation of the method, by considering five tunnel sections including circular, elliptical, horseshoe, square and rectangular, the surface response is sensitized to observe the normalized displacement amplitude/amplification ratio. In this regard, the angle of the incident wave and the frequency of the response are also included in changing the response pattern. To illustrate the results in both time and frequency domains, they are presented as blanket charts, snapshots, and three-/two-dimensional diagrams. The results showed that the seismic response of the surface is extremely affected by the geometric parameters of underground tunnels, which can create different conditions on the ground surface with shifting the direction of the wavefront."},

A three-dimensional finite element method, implemented via the numerical software ABAQUS, has been employed for modeling purposes. After briefly presenting the theoretical foundations of the finite element method and validating the approach through a benchmark example, a sensitivity analysis of the ground surface response is conducted, considering key parameters such as tunnel depth and the impedance ratio of the lining relative to the surrounding soil. Subsequently, a comparative study is performed between the three-dimensional results and two-dimensional half-space boundary element responses. The findings indicate that at depth ratios of 5 and 8, for P/SV and SH waves respectively, the tunnel‚Äôs influence diminishes, and the response converges toward that of the free-field ground motion. Moreover, for in-plane P/SV wave incidence, each unit increase in the impedance ratio contributes to a minimum reduction of approximately 5% in the horizontal response at the tunnel crown, whereas for out-of-plane SH waves, an opposite trend is observed. The results of this study can provide valuable insights for the refinement and enhancement of current seismic design codes regarding site microzonation in the presence of subsurface openings."},
